![grid](media/nftgrid.gif)

GANFT is a novel implementation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to create original, Crypto-Punk themed NFTs automatically.

## Data
The database consisted of ~10,000 24x24 images of Crypto-Punk NFTs ever created and sold by [LarvaLabs](https://larvalabs.com/cryptopunks).

## Model
GANS

## Compute
The model was run on Nvidia's `Tesla V-100` on Google Cloud in 7-8 hours.
